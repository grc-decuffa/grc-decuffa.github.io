            <p>Colour Clothing </p><!--Change it to the name of the company-->
            
            <p>Colour is a clothing brand that my friend and I recently started. Our vision was to create streetwear that never goes out of style, but most importanrly to create hoodies that are comfortable. Our line consists of just hoodies for right now, but we plan on expanding to include sweatpants and basic tees. </p><!--Short description of the company-->
            
            <h2>Target audience</h2>
            
            <p> Colour clothing was made to be worn by everyone and anyone who loves to be comfortable in their clothes. We believe our brand best identifies with young adults, but we also have children and senior citizens interested in Colour. All ages are welcome :)  </p><!-- Who are the people who use this site? -->
           
            <p>If you are looking for casual clothing that is cute and comfortable, you have come to the right place. Customers will browse our collection and choose a hoodie from our selected colors that best compliments them.</p><!-- What are their primary task and goals? -->
