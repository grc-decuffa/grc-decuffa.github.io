<h2>Our Story</h2>
<h1>From Our Family To Yours </h1>
<p>Welcome to Brickley’s Ice Cream. We appreciate you taking the time to get to know us.
At Brickley’s, we make all our own ice cream onsite at out Narragansett, Rhode Island location. On any given day you we have over 45 flavors ice cream, frozen yogurt, no-sugar added ice cream, sherbets and sorbet. Great ice cream made fresh daily with only the best ingredients so that every cone you have will be the best.</p>

<p>Our first store was a converted former doctor’s office on Ten Rod Road in North Kingstown, Rhode Island. The first priority in developing our business was making our great ice cream. We wanted to make great tasting, creamy “homemade” ice cream that our customers would truly enjoy.</p>

<p>My wife Chris and I started Brickley’s with the help of our families back in 1995. You will see our children, Ryan and Kerry behind the counter at any given time along with my sister Maureen and brother Len. My nephews Brendon and Mark started working with us as teenagers and still help out a bit even now that they have moved on in the their respective careers.</p>

<p>Now, going into our 23rd season, we have moved our North Kingstown store to Narragansett, Rhode Island (near the beautiful beaches) and opened a 2nd location in historic Wakefield, Rhode Island. In our 22 years of business we have been awarded the “Best Ice Cream in South County” distinction from Rhode Island Monthly every season. We are particularly proud of this award as it is given by the readers of Rhode Island Monthly. In addition, Yankee Travel highlighted us in their publication as well. We have consistently been award the “Best Ice Cream in South County” award from the NRI family of local newspapers.</p>

<p>Thanks again for visiting us at Brickley’s. Stop in for a fresh made waffle cone.</p>
